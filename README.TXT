VERSION or DATE: April 9, 2021

AUTHORS: Nour Mihamou and Lulama Nyembe

USER INSTRUCTIONS: A user will be prompted to type in the name of a csv file (ie "ticketsA.csv"), which should be a R x 5 matrix of numbers (each row represents a ticket). Then a random set of five integers will be generated representing the winning lottery ticket. The program should appropriately parse through the csv file and tally all the lottery ticket matches and output the numbers matched, the number of tickets that had that many numbers matched, payout per matched ticket, and total payout, as well as total profit.
